# What is this?

A proof-of-concept for using GitHub Discussions as the backend for comments on GOV.‌UK Design System backlog items.

## Why?

Many digital specialists across government, apart from developers, are uncomfortable with using GitHub as they believe it’s ‘not for them’. This proof-of-concept was to show that it’s possible to design around that while still keeping existing comments and discussion stored on GitHub.

# Notes

This is a super hacky proof-of-concept that took me, like, 90 minutes on a Thursday morning. After sharing it with the team, a next step would have been taking it to users to test their reactions to the prototype.
